# Placeholder Image

This is a placeholder for product images that fail to load or are not available.

To replace this with an actual image:

1. Add a placeholder-image.jpg file to this directory
2. Or update the ProductCard component to use a different fallback image

The current implementation uses a base64-encoded placeholder for better performance.
